# Styling Conventions

The application uses a combination of Tailwind CSS and custom CSS:

- [styles/globals.css](mdc:styles/globals.css): Global styles, including custom animations and utilities
- [tailwind.config.js](mdc:tailwind.config.js): Tailwind configuration and theme customization

## CSS Structure

- Base styling is provided by Tailwind utility classes
- Custom components often use a combination of Tailwind and custom CSS classes
- Page transitions use CSS animations defined in globals.css
- Responsive design breakpoints follow Tailwind's default configuration

## Animation Guidelines

- Page transitions use transform and opacity properties for performance
- Hardware acceleration is enabled with transform, backface-visibility, and perspective properties
- Progress bars and loading states use CSS animations with custom timing functions
