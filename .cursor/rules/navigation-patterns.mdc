# Navigation Patterns

## Main Navigation

The application uses Next.js routing with the following key navigation patterns:

- Sidebar navigation: Primary way to navigate between main sections
- Breadcrumbs: Used for hierarchical navigation within sections
- Modal-based forms: Forms often appear in modals rather than separate pages

## Key Routes

- [pages/index.js](mdc:pages/index.js): Dashboard with KPIs and summary charts
- [pages/transaksi.js](mdc:pages/transaksi.js): Transaction list and management
- [pages/customer.js](mdc:pages/customer.js): Customer management
- [pages/laporan.js](mdc:pages/laporan.js): Report generation and viewing
- [src/app/auth/signin/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/auth/signin/page.tsx): Sign in page
- [src/app/auth/signup/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/auth/signup/page.tsx): Sign up page

## Transition Effects

Page transitions include:
- Fade transitions between main pages
- Progress bar animations during page loading
- Staggered animations for content elements
